# UniHosp - United Hospital

UniHosp stands for United Hospitals acronym we made for our website name. We built this project with the thinking to convert entire health sector digital by recording all the medical history of the citizen of India into database and which they can by a given Uni ID which a user can create during the registration. We are trying built a prototype to connect all the hospital like UPI connected all the banks for online revolution of Indian Financial Sector.

## Problem Being Addressed

Suppose a person had a medical surgery in one state and changed city after few years. If he needed a new surgery the doctor might need past medical records and checkup reports.
Now If that is the case it can be possible that those documents got lost or damaged or not in very good condition to be read or understand. And if that's the case, that person might to go through another body check up which is cost him a lot money. As India's health sector is not cheap, If you are in India there is great chance you know that.

## Solution

There is very simple solution to convert entire health sector of India digital and save all the data related to citizens health in clouds and give access to user of these services to monitor there health profile and control the access who see and who can't so that can be accessed as they need the profile can be shared.

This service will work like UPI, Every Person will be given a Uni ID as we named it for a while. With the Help Of Uni ID hospitals will be able update citizen health report on cloud which is going to be managed centrally like any other servers. User is can access these reports in there Health Profile.

## Addressed Problem and Services

1. Anytime access of past medical records using UniID
2. Helps in finding Hospital and Making appointments with doctors
3. Notifications related Profile Access, Health Issues, Doctor Appointments
4. Health Profile Access Management

Note:
We are trying to hide as much as secret keys and token as we can so please be carefull if you are trying to exploit.

#### Uniserver

Uniserver is an nest.js server which is the main server
In main branch it is located at:
`uniserver`
In the uniserver main folder one is `prisma` and `src`
`prisma` Consits of our database schema
`src` Consists of authentication and all the logics of it's not yet completely perfect

## Technologies Used:

1. Google Cloud Instance for website building and deployment.
2. Google Cloud SQL for Database hosting.
3. Node.js, Nest.js for server design, Prisma ORM For database connection
4. Socket IO for notification services.
5. Programming Languages - _Typescript/Javascript_
6. Angular framework for frontend.
7. Services Used - Elastic Mail

# Project Setup

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- You have installed the latest version of [Node.js and npm](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

To Setup this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

### Server Setup

## Setting Up Environment Variables

This project requires certain environment variables to be set. Here's how you can set them up:

1. In the root directory of the project, create a new file and name it `.env`.

2. Open the `.env` file and set the environment variables in this format:

   ```bash
   DATABASE_URL_ROOT=<your_postgres_database_url>
   PRIVATE_TOKEN_KEY=<your_private_token_key>
   JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRE=86400000
   ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRATION=86400000
   REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRATION=86400000
   DEVELOPMENT_KEY=86dff15115508c9fb1da8c748740e753
   BEARER=<bearer_name>
   ```

Replace `<your_database_url>` and `<your_private_token_key>` with your actual database URL and private token key.

example your_private_token_key = 0eedfcd5776881153393943dc8a86478c100d58366ac277d84053703...

3. Save the `.env` file. The application will now have access to the values you set in the `.env` file.

4. Install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

If you don't want to install below package globally run commands with `npx` prefix

```
npm install -g nx@latest
```

5. Prisma Generate

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev ---name dev
npx prisma generate
```

6. Start Server

```bash
nx serve uniserver
```

or

```bash
npx nx serve uniserver
```

   --build-arg PRIVATE_TOKEN_KEY=<your_private_token_key> \
   --build-arg JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRE=86400000 \
   --build-arg ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRATION=86400000 \
   --build-arg REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRATION=86400000 \
   --build-arg DEVELOPMENT_KEY=86dff15115508c9fb1da8c748740e753 \
   --build-arg BEARER=<bearer_name>
   ```

   docker run -it -d -e DATABASE_URL_ROOT=<your_postgres_database_url> \
   -e PRIVATE_TOKEN_KEY=<your_private_token_key> \
   -e JWT_REFRESH_EXPIRE=86400000 \
   -e ACCESS_TOKEN_EXPIRATION=86400000 \
   -e REFRESH_TOKEN_EXPIRATION=86400000 \
   -e DEVELOPMENT_KEY=86dff15115508c9fb1da8c748740e753 \
